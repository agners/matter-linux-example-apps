## Matter OTA Provider

This repository provides the building infrastructure to build the Matter OTA
Provider used by the [Python Matter Server](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/python-matter-server).
The OTA Provider is built straight from the upstream OTA Provider example at
`examples/ota-provider-app/linux` with a custom CHIP app configuration.

Binaries from builds of (tagged) releases and pre-releases for Linux x86-64 and
aarch64/arm64 will be uploaded to the release page.
